This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Background

This is a simple application that uses many fundamentals of React. It is fully responsive and uses TailwindCSS for styling.

It uses easy to read, clean and maintainable code. The application is optimized for performance (use of memoization of prop callbacks, components and of API call), and SEO friendly (e.g. no content shifts on alerts or real-time validation, enhancing accessibility, using semantic HTML).

It uses the power of React by using reusable components (Alerts, Buttons, Inputs) as well as Higher-order components to extend the functionality of simpler components (Spinner overlay, Flashing effect), conditional rendering, conditional styling, states, props, various event listeners, REST API call etc. It includes many states, but doesnâ€™t create unnecessary ones (e.g. hasErrorColor is only a variable derived from errorMessageColor state).

## To Run This Application
